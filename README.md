# What is this repository?

This repository is for the users of the WAPLink in Minnesota.  It provides a open/public forum for known issues, feature requests, workarounds, best practices, and useful files for the Weatherization program.

# Why is this repository useful?


This repository is a place for users to share problems, solutions, ideas for new features and reports.  The issue tracker in GitHub is a good solution for this task since it is public, searchable, and editable.  It can also store images as part of the issue. This lets us share screenshots that demonstrate problems and solutions.  A picture is worth many words.

# How to participate?

The main thing here is the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/fishbaugher/WAPLink-Issues/issues) which is the second tab in the main repository page right after 'Code'.  The code page is where shared files are stored and accessed. On the Issues page, you should be able to see open and closed issues, labels on issues, and a search bar.

Feel free to press the [New issue](https://github.com/fishbaugher/WAPLink-Issues/issues/new) button and fully describe your problem or idea.  Screenshots are very helpful as well.  Just take a screenshot that illustrates the problem or idea, then simply drag your screenshot file into the issue comment area for everyone to see.

# Who maintains and contributes to the project?

Any users, developers, administrators of WAPLink are welcome to contribute.

The initial set of issues and ideas for this repository was contributed by WAPLink users in the state of Minnesota, but the idea is to involve all users.  You can create issues and reply to other users in a shared environment.

Let's keep the focus on WAPLink usage in this repository.  Other DOE Weatherization program issues and discussions have their own forums.
